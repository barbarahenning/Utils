1 - Run Reslice2.ijm and save the smooth volume (can be improved)
	> Check which channels of .lsm files correspond to EDU and DAPI
	> Make sure there is no "." in .lsm files names
	> Check the images Preview-XXX to see whether ROI matches the resulting images

2 - Use paraview to open the resulting smooth volumes and create 3D surface

3 - Run the Python code makebox using Paraview in Mac Air

4 - Run dapiSeg.cxx to get the files _Points.vtk

5 - Run proQuant.cxx to get the files _results.txt

6 - Run TestEDU-DAPI-Ratio.ijm

7 - Run DistanceAnalyze.R
